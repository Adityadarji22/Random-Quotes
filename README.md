# Random Quotes Machine
This project creates a responsive website diaplaying random quotes extracted from [wikiquote.org](https://www.wikiquote.org/) using [this API](https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api). A specific author can also be selected to display quotes using buttons on large devices and using an off-canvas menu on smaller deevices. The page uses Bootstrap4. Project demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ssaleem/Random-Quotes/blob/responsive/index.html).
