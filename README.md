# Random Quotes Machine
This project creates a responsive website diaplaying random quotes extracted from [wikiquote.org](https://www.wikiquote.org/) using [this API](https://github.com/natetyler/wikiquotes-api). A specific author can also be selected to display quotes using author buttons on large devices and an off-canvas menu on smaller devices. The page uses Bootstrap4. Project demo can be found [here](https://ssaleem.github.io/Random-Quotes/).
